# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects

This repository contains my **Java OOP projects** developed as part of my university coursework under the guidance of **Roberta Bardini**.  

These projects cover **core OOP concepts, collections, streams, persistence with Hibernate, and real-world simulations**, progressively increasing in complexity.

> **Note:** This is a **learning project series** completed during the **Object-Oriented Programming course** by *Roberta Bardini*.  
> All credits for the course materials and assignments go to **Roberta Bardini**.

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-oop-projects.git
   cd java-oop-projects
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred **Java IDE**.
3. Compile and run individual labs:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/**/*.java
   java -cp bin university.Main   # Example for Lab 1
   ```
4. For **Lab 6**, ensure **Hibernate dependencies** and a proper **persistence.xml** are configured.
